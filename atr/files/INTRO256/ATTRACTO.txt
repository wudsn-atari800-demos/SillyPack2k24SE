Title:   Attractor
Author:  Pawel Matusz

Info:    Requires a clean boot. 
         Memory should be clear.
         No sound
         Now runs from DOS 2.5

The original idea had been to
iteratively converge several strands
of pixels towards a moving attractor.
As usual squeezing it into 256 bytes
proved a challenge which resulted in
something  slightly different, but
still interesting.
