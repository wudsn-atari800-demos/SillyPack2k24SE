Hello !
...sorry for my bad English...

I am a programmer from the Czech Republic. I have programmed amazing games such as:
 - ZdendaZuma I.
 - ZdendaZuma II. (with 7 datadisks)
 - Pacman labyrinth
 - Space invaders battle
 - Dark City Road
 - Greedy bat
 - Tetris T
 - Planet Rescue Mission
 - Ufon
 - Ninja-help-icopter
 - Robbery
 - Firefighter Tobik I.
 - Multijoy roulette for 17-players
 - Bombeeno
 - Robot and Minion
 - Eternal Meteors (I will send this game to SV WE 24 competition)
 - Defense Horizon (I will send this game to SV WE 24 competition)
 - etc...
I confirm that I wrote all these games by myself, every one byte, in pure assembler :)

===== Firefighter Tobik II.
============================

   This game is the continuation of my game Firefighter Tobik I., but this time it is for Atari computers with a memory expansion of 1MB rambo.
I tested it on Atari 600XL and 800XL with "AVG SUB cart".

The player selects a mission from the list (out of a total of 20 missions), where the fire is and where he will go to extinguish it.
Missions are located in a factory, in a hospital, on the Moon, on Neptun orbit and so on.
The fireman can walk/jump/fall through a fire, it doesn't bother him even if he is standing in it.
Player can choose difficulty EASY or HARD.

Interesting features are defined for each mission:
 1) GRAVITY POTENTIAL - for example, on the Moon, firefighter can jump higher than on Earth, but on a mission to Neptun, on the contrary, lower.
 2) DENSITY OF THE ATMOSPHERE - the firefighter moves slower/faster on the mission. 
 3) FLAMMABLE CONTENT IN ATMOSPHERE – the fire spreads faster/slower.
 
On players back he has a small container with firefighting liquid, which will run out as he extinguishes.
When he runs out of liquid, he has to crouch down by the hydrant and the liquid in the container on his back complements. 
As for the liquid - in some places it will be extinguished with water (blue), but in some places it can also be extinguished with something else 
(green slime, ...).

Firefighter can be promoted or can get a ribbon of the medal, which can then be seen on the NOTICE-BOARD (using "N" key on main screen).

In each mission there is one important object that must not start burning.
In order for the mission to be successful, it is necessary to put out all the fires before the important object starts burning.
If the important object starts burning, the mission is immediately failed.

IMPORTANT: fire spreads randomly during the mission - just like in real life. So sometimes it happens that a firefighter doesn't complete a mission even if he does everything right - just like it can happen in real life. In that case, the player can play the mission again.
