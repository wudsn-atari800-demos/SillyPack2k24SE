====================
M A F I A  -  MANUAL
====================

It is the year 1920 in Chicago.
Alcohol is prohibited, crime thrives. 
Store  owners live in constant fear
of robberies and extortions, which
are becoming more frequent. Anyone
can obtain illegal firearms, and the 
orrupt police are no help. 

You are a nobody just released from
prison, even hot dog vendors laugh
at you. Enough is enough. You crave
control of the underworld. But the
path to the  mafia throne is long and
hard. 

Will you succeed?

Goal 
====

Rise up and become the boss of the
underworld! Compete against your
fellow players!

For every job, every murder, every
smuggling, every bribery, and every
robbery you gain more fame (and
points).

But only those who manage to 'turn'
the mayor in the end and 'borrow'
the gold in the money transporter
can be the boss of the underworld...

Controls
========

The game is controlled with the
keyboard, but almost always you can
also use the joystick. In some
situations, you can go back by
pressing '0',  for example, when
purchasing a weapon or a car.

Map:
ESC = Show gangsters and current
game status

Fight
=====

Combat is turn-based, each gangster
can move or shoot.

Press Return (or fire) to draw your
weapon and an arrow key (or move your
joystick) to shoot in that direction.

q = Give up the fight
    (beginners only)
i = Activate the AI
        (after the next move)
SPACE = Skip the round
